# The Necromancer Beta 1.0.1 Release

*"In the shadows of Mirkwood's eaves, a darkness stirs beneath the leaves..."*

We're excited to announce the first beta release of **The Necromancer**, a roguelike adventure set in Tolkien's Third Age of Middle-earth!

## What is The Necromancer?

The Necromancer is a tactical roguelike game forked from the excellent Sil-Q project. Set in Dol Guldur during the dark years when the Necromancer (Sauron in disguise) claimed his tower in Mirkwood, you must descend into the depths and face the servants of the Shadow.

Your goal: Retrieve Thrain's ring, the key, and the map before the darkness claims you.

## Key Features

- **Deep tactical combat** - Every encounter matters
- **Rich character development** - Skills and abilities that shape your playstyle
- **Permadeath** - High stakes, meaningful choices
- **New content** - Themed equipment, new consumables, reworked mechanics

## What's New from Sil-Q

- **New Setting**: Dol Guldur replaces Angband as your destination
- **Themed Equipment**: Weapons, armor, and artefacts renamed to fit the setting
- **Wands System**: New consumable items with various magical effects
- **Poison Streams**: Reworked mechanic - Con check affects severity, not avoidance
- **Complete Rebranding**: New name, new title screens, fresh start
