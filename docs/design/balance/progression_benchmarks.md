# Progression Benchmarks

## Document: DESIGN-004

## Overview

This document defines target skill levels by depth for a "healthy" character progression. These benchmarks will be used to validate the +30% XP changes.

---

## Design Philosophy

1. **Primary skills should feel strong** at their intended depth
2. **Secondary skills should be affordable** as "survival tax"
3. **Players should feel progression** every 100ft
4. **Build should be "online"** (competent) by depth 500ft
5. **All playstyles viable** - combat, stealth, and hybrid

---

## Skill Categories

### Primary Combat Skills
- **Melee**: Direct combat effectiveness
- **Evasion**: Survival, avoiding damage
- **Archery**: Ranged combat (alternative to Melee)

### Survival Skills
- **Will**: Resist fear, confusion, dark magic
- **Perception**: See enemies, find traps/secrets

### Utility Skills
- **Stealth**: Avoid combat, get better positioning
- **Smithing**: Craft/improve equipment
- **Lore**: Identify items, knowledge

## Critical Checkpoints

### Depth 300ft - "Viability Check"

This is the reported problem depth. By 300ft, players should have:

**Combat:**
- Melee + Evasion >= 15 (minimum)
- Will >= 4 (resist fear/confusion)
- Perception >= 3 (basic awareness)

**Stealth:**
- Stealth + Evasion >= 14 (minimum)
- Perception >= 5 (see threats)
- Will >= 3 (resist fear)

**XP Needed:** ~9,500-10,000

**With +30% boost:** ~12,000 XP available (PASS)

---

### Depth 500ft - "Build Online"

By 500ft, core build should be fully functional:

**Combat:**
- Primary skill >= 10
- Secondary skill >= 9
- Can handle most encounters

**Stealth:**
- Stealth >= 10
- Evasion >= 8
- Can bypass most threats

**XP Needed:** ~15,000-17,000

**With +30% boost:** ~18,000 XP available (PASS)

---

### Depth 750ft - "Late Game Ready"

Preparing for Nazgûl and Inner Sanctum:

**All Builds:**
- Primary skills >= 12
- Will >= 6 (resist wraith abilities)
- Some specialized abilities purchased

**XP Needed:** ~25,000

**With +30% boost:** ~28,000 XP available (PASS)

---

## Ability Budget

With the XP available after skills, players should be able to afford:

| Depth | Skill XP | Remaining for Abilities | Abilities Affordable |
|-------|----------|------------------------|---------------------|
| 300ft | 9,500 | 2,500 | 2-3 abilities |
| 500ft | 15,000 | 3,000 | 3-4 abilities |
| 750ft | 25,000 | 3,000 | 4-5 abilities |
| 1000ft | 38,000 | 4,000 | 5-6 abilities |

---

## Validation Criteria

### Success: +30% XP is Working

- [ ] Combat build reaches Melee 8 + Eva 7 by depth 300ft
- [ ] Stealth build reaches Stealth 8 + Eva 6 by depth 300ft
- [ ] Players can afford 2+ abilities by depth 300ft
- [ ] Will/Perception feel like affordable "taxes"
- [ ] Hybrid builds are viable (not forced to hyper-specialize)
- [ ] Deaths feel like tactical mistakes, not XP starvation

### Failure: Need More XP

- Combat build can't reach Melee + Eva >= 14 at 300ft
- Can't afford any abilities until depth 400ft+
- Forced to skip Will entirely (dying to fear/confusion)
- Stealth builds significantly behind combat builds

### Over-Correction: Too Much XP

- Reaching skill 10+ before depth 300ft
- Affording 5+ abilities by mid-game
- Game feels too easy
- No meaningful skill choices (can max everything)

## Playtest Recording Template

During testing, record:

```
Character: [Name] ([Race]/[House])

- Total XP: ____

- Feel: [Struggling/OK/Comfortable/Easy]

Depth 200ft:
- Skills: Mel: __ Eva: __ Stl: __ Per: __ Wil: __
- Total XP: ____
- Abilities: ____
- Feel: [Struggling/OK/Comfortable/Easy]

Depth 300ft:
- Skills: Mel: __ Eva: __ Stl: __ Per: __ Wil: __
- Total XP: ____
- Abilities: ____
- Feel: [Struggling/OK/Comfortable/Easy]

Notes:
- Biggest threat: ____
- XP felt: [Starved/Tight/Adequate/Abundant]
- Deaths: ____ (causes: ____)
```

## Summary

These benchmarks define "healthy" progression. With +30% XP:

1. **Combat builds** should hit 8+7 in primary skills by 300ft
2. **Stealth builds** should hit 8+6 in primary skills by 300ft
3. **All builds** should afford 2-3 abilities by 300ft
4. **Core builds** should be "online" by 500ft
5. **Will/Perception** should be affordable without gutting primary build

If playtesting doesn't meet these benchmarks, increase XP multiplier. If it exceeds them significantly, consider reducing to +25%.
