# Power Scale Validation: Third Age Cap

## Design Principle

"The Third Age is diminished. No flashy magic. Power through skill, knowledge, and will."

This validates all abilities respect the Third Age power ceiling.

---

## Third Age Power Examples (Maximum)

From Tolkien:
- Gandalf's "You shall not pass" (contest of wills)
- Elrond's healing of Frodo (weeks of treatment)
- Galadriel's mirror (showing, not controlling)
- Aragorn's athelas healing (herbs + royal touch)
- Words of power ("Mellon" opens door)

## What DOESN'T Happen in Third Age

- Combat magic (fireballs, lightning)
- Teleportation
- Resurrection
- Mind control (except corrupted Saruman)
- Summoning creatures
- Transformation/shapeshifting
- Weather control (except Ring-bearers)

Key observations:
1. No direct combat magic (fireballs, lightning)
2. No teleportation or resurrection
3. No mind control (Word of Mastery is borderline)
4. All abilities trace to Tolkien precedent
5. Power comes from skill, will, and knowledge - not flashy magic

The ability system successfully captures the diminished but still wondrous nature of the Third Age.
