## Will-Based Phenomena in Third Age

### Resisting Evil
1. **Ring corruption** - The central test of will
2. **Nazgul fear** - Black Breath, terror aura
3. **Morgul wounds** - Resisting becoming a wraith
4. **Sauron's Eye** - Withstanding attention
5. **Saruman's voice** - Resisting persuasion

### Mental Contests
1. **Palantír duels** - Aragorn vs Sauron
2. **Command of dead** - Aragorn in Paths of Dead
3. **Breaking spells** - Theoden freed from Saruman

### Endurance
1. **Carrying burdens** - Frodo with Ring
2. **Hope in darkness** - Sam in Mordor
3. **Physical pain** - Continuing despite wounds

## Power Ceiling Examples

### Maximum Feats (Third Age cap)
- Aragorn's Palantír confrontation (contest with Sauron himself)
- Frodo carrying the Ring to Mount Doom
- Gandalf vs Balrog will contest ("You shall not pass!")

### What DOESN'T Happen
- No mind control of others (except Sauron/Saruman powers)
- No telekinesis
- No psychic attacks
- Will is defensive/endurance, not offensive

## Stealth Synergies

Will supports stealth through:
1. **Staying calm** when hiding from terror (Nazgul)
2. **Patience** under pressure
3. **Resisting despair** during long infiltrations
4. **Not breaking** when discovered

## Current Will Tree Analysis

1. Curse Breaking - Remove curses
2. Channeling - Better staff/horn use
3. Strength in Adversity - Bonuses when hurt
4. Formidable - Kills scare enemies, injuries don't encourage them
5. Inner Light - +2 light intensity
6. Indomitable - Resist fear/confuse/stun/hallucinate
7. Oath - Swear oath for rewards
8. Poison Resistance - Resist poison
9. Vengeance - Extra damage after being hit
10. Majesty - Lower enemy morale
11. Constitution - +1 Con

**Assessment**: Good core identity around mental fortitude and leadership. Inner Light feels more like Lore. Channeling is device-focused.
