# Evasion Research: Third Age Precedents

## Third Age Mobility/Defense Examples

### Aragorn
- **Weathertop**: Defensive fighting against five Nazgul
- **Moria**: Leading retreat through narrow passages
- **Amon Hen**: Mobile defense against Uruk-hai

*Techniques implied*: Defensive footwork, fighting retreats, using terrain

### Legolas
- **Moria**: Acrobatic movement, shield-surfing (film, not book)
- **Helm's Deep**: Mobile archer, repositioning constantly

*Techniques implied*: Agility, quick movement between positions

### Gimli
- **Helm's Deep**: Standing ground, not evading but enduring
- Dwarven steadfastness over mobility

*Techniques implied*: Heavy armor use, standing firm

### Boromir
- **Shield use**: Gondorian captain with shield
- **Last stand**: Fighting from defensive position

*Techniques implied*: Shield blocking, defensive formations

### Sam and Frodo
- **Cirith Ungol**: Dodging Shelob's attacks
- **Mordor**: Evading patrols

*Techniques implied*: Small size advantage, quick movements

### Gondorian Soldiers
- **Osgiliath**: Fighting retreat across bridges
- **Minas Tirith**: Wall defense, shield walls

*Techniques implied*: Formation defense, controlled retreat, shield blocking

### Rohirrim
- **Cavalry mobility**: Hit and run tactics
- **Dismounted**: Fighting from horseback then on foot

*Techniques implied*: Mobile warfare, repositioning

## Defense Techniques Mentioned or Implied

### Dodging/Agility
1. **Dodging** - Avoiding attacks through movement
2. **Leaping** - Jumping obstacles, gaps
3. **Sprinting** - Quick bursts of speed
4. **Acrobatic movement** - Legolas-style (borderline)

### Blocking/Parrying
1. **Shield blocking** - Gondorian standard
2. **Parrying with weapon** - Sword dueling technique
3. **Heavy armor** - Dwarven/Gondorian style

### Tactical Movement
1. **Flanking** - Moving around enemies
2. **Fighting retreat** - Controlled withdrawal
3. **Crowd fighting** - Handling multiple enemies

## Power Ceiling Examples

### Maximum Feats (Third Age cap)
- Aragorn holding off five Nazgul briefly
- Legolas's agility (book version - graceful, not superhuman)
- Sam driving off Shelob with desperate defense

### What DOESN'T Happen
- No Matrix-style bullet dodging
- No supernatural reflexes
- No avoiding everything through pure skill
- Armor and shields matter significantly

## Stealth Synergies to Consider

1. **Flanking** - Move around enemies from stealth
2. **Controlled Retreat** - Escape after breaking stealth
3. **Sprinting** - Quick escape from detection
4. **Dodging** - Survival when stealth fails

## Recommendations for Evasion Tree

### Keep (Good Third Age fit)
- Dodging (basic evasion)
- Blocking (shield defense)
- Parry (weapon defense)
- Crowd Fighting (handling groups)
- Leaping (practical mobility)
- Sprinting (movement speed)
- Flanking (tactical movement)
- Heavy Armour Use (Dwarven/Gondorian style)
- Riposte (counterattack)
- Controlled Retreat (fighting withdrawal)

### Tree Assessment
The Evasion tree is actually very solid for Third Age grounding. All abilities have clear precedents. May need only minor tweaks.
