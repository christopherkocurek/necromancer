# === FRAMES 21-30: Hold both lines, then fade to black ===

[FRAME 21-25] delay=200 each
# Hold on both lines for emotional impact

[FRAME 26-28] delay=150 each
# Begin fading text out (reverse color sequence)
# WHITE -> GRAY -> DARK_GRAY

[FRAME 29-30] delay=200 each
# Fade to black
# Screen completely dark, ready for Scene 4 (Tombstone)

# Notes for implementation:
# - Text should be centered horizontally
# - Use Term_putstr with appropriate color codes
# - Consider subtle flicker effect on "Necromancer"
# - The ellipsis "..." should appear one dot at a time for extra drama
# - Transition to Scene 4 should be seamless (black to black)
