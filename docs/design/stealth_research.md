# Stealth Research: Third Age Precedents

## CRITICAL: Stealth is Core Gameplay

Per design principles: "Every viable build invests ~5 points in Stealth. Infiltration is core gameplay."

The Stealth tree must be:
1. Universally attractive for all builds
2. Have synergies with every other tree
3. Support the "burglar" fantasy of The Hobbit

## Third Age Stealth Examples

### Bilbo Baggins (The Burglar)
- **Trolls**: Attempted pickpocket, sneaking
- **Gollum's cave**: Silent movement, hiding in darkness
- **Mirkwood spiders**: Sneaking among sleeping spiders
- **Smaug's lair**: Multiple infiltrations, stealing the Arkenstone
- **Five Armies**: Moving unseen on battlefield

*Techniques implied*: Silent movement, hiding, pickpocketing, patience, using darkness, small size advantage

### Frodo and Sam
- **Black Riders**: Hiding from Nazgul multiple times
- **Bree**: Moving unseen through town
- **Moria**: Quiet movement (attempted)
- **Emyn Muil to Mordor**: Evading patrols
- **Cirith Ungol**: Sneaking past orcs
- **Mordor plains**: Disguised as orcs, moving among enemies

*Techniques implied*: Hiding, disguise, patience, using terrain, moving at night

### Gandalf
- **Dol Guldur** (backstory): Infiltrated the fortress to confirm Sauron's presence
- **Moria**: Knowledge of secret ways

*Techniques implied*: Intelligence gathering, secret passages, lore-based infiltration

### Rangers of the North
- **Aragorn**: Moving unseen in wilderness, tracking
- **Grey Company**: Traveling undetected

*Techniques implied*: Wilderness stealth, tracking, ambush

### Rangers of Ithilien
- **Faramir's company**: Hidden camps, ambush tactics
- **Henneth Annun**: Secret base

*Techniques implied*: Military stealth, ambush, concealment

### Gollum
- **Following the Fellowship**: Undetected for months
- **Moria, Emyn Muil**: Expert at hiding, climbing

*Techniques implied*: Patience, stalking, climbing, survival

## Stealth Techniques Mentioned or Implied

### Movement
1. **Silent movement** - Not making noise
2. **Slow careful movement** - Patience
3. **Quick dashes** - Moving between cover
4. **Climbing** - Gollum, accessing alternate routes

### Concealment
1. **Hiding in shadows** - Using darkness
2. **Disguise** - Sam and Frodo as orcs
3. **Stillness** - Freezing to avoid detection
4. **Using terrain** - Cover, undergrowth

### Actions from Stealth
1. **Assassination** - Striking unwary enemies
2. **Pickpocketing** - Bilbo with trolls
3. **Reconnaissance** - Gandalf at Dol Guldur
4. **Escape** - Breaking away when detected

## Power Ceiling Examples

### Maximum Feats (Third Age cap)
- Bilbo infiltrating Smaug's lair multiple times
- Frodo/Sam crossing Mordor
- Gandalf's infiltration of Dol Guldur

### What DOESN'T Happen
- No invisibility (without Ring)
- No teleportation
- No walking through walls
- No perfect undetectability

## Synergies Needed for Other Trees

### Melee Synergies (Add if missing)
- Opening Strike from stealth (added to Melee tree)
- Assassination already provides bonus vs unwary

### Archery Synergies (Already good)
- Ambush in Archery tree

### Evasion Synergies (Already good)
- Flanking, Controlled Retreat for escape

### Perception Synergies
- Listen helps know where to sneak
- Should stealth help perception? (detecting if detected)

### Will Synergies
- Resisting fear when hiding from Nazgul
- Patience under pressure

### Lore Synergies
- Lore of Silence already exists
- Knowledge of secret ways

## Current Stealth Tree Analysis

Current abilities:
1. Disguise - Halves LoS detection bonus (good)
2. Assassination - +Stealth to melee vs unwary (good)
3. Cruel Blow - Crits confuse (stealth + melee)
4. Exchange Places - Swap with enemy (utility)
5. Opportunist - Free attack on fleeing (melee synergy)
6. Vanish - +10 stealth to make unwary (core)
7. Dexterity - +1 Dex (capstone)

**Assessment**: Tree is small (7 abilities) but focused. Could expand for more synergies.

## Recommendations

### Keep
- Disguise (1) - Concealment
- Assassination (2) - Core stealth-melee synergy
- Vanish (5) - Re-establishing stealth

### Modify
- Cruel Blow (3) - Consider renaming to be more stealth-thematic
- Exchange Places (4) - Useful but not obviously stealth
- Opportunist (5) - More melee than stealth

### Consider Adding
- **Burglar's Hands** - Improved lockpicking/trap disarm (Bilbo)
- **Shadow Walk** - Improved stealth in darkness (using shadows)
- **Patient Hunter** - Bonus for waiting/not acting (Gollum stalking)
