## CONCLUSION

### Removal Count: 0

The monster.txt file has been carefully designed for The Necromancer setting. All monsters:
1. Fit the Dol Guldur theme
2. Serve a unique tactical purpose
3. Support the layer progression
4. Align with Tolkien lore

### Recommendation
Instead of removing monsters, **add new stealth-focused variants** (see MON-005) to fill gameplay gaps.

---

## PRUNING NOT RECOMMENDED

The monster roster is well-designed. Focus development effort on:
1. Adding new monsters (MON-005)
2. Modifying existing monsters (MON-007)
3. Code support for new mechanics (HANDLER, PATROL, etc.)
