# Stealth Audit: Current Abilities vs Third Age Precedents

## Critical Context

Stealth is the CORE tree per design principles:
- Every viable build should invest ~5 points
- Tree must have hooks for all playstyles
- Supports "burglar" fantasy central to The Hobbit

## Audit Questions Applied to Each Ability
