- Reference peoples: Rangers, Dúnedain, Dwarves, Silvan, Gondorian
- Avoid modern terms: "awesome", "amazing", "cool"

### Dol Guldur Theme
- Shadow imagery: "drinks the light", "touched by shadow", "dark origins"
- Corruption: "warped", "twisted", "hungry"
- Mystery: "strange metal", "unknown origins"

### Functional Hints
- Throwing weapons: "can be thrown"
- Two-handed: "requires two hands"
- Stealth: "quiet", "blend into shadows"
