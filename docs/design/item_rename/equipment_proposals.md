## TV_CLOAK (35) - Cloaks

| ID | OLD NAME | NEW NAME | Rationale | Refs |

| 411 | Mallorn Torch | **Mallorn Torch** | KEEP - Mallorn is canonical (Lothlórien trees). | LOW |
| 21 | Lesser Jewel | **Elven Light** | "Lesser Jewel" is generic. "Elven Light" evokes Elven enchantment. | LOW |

| 131 | Star-glass | **Star-glass** | KEEP - References Phial of Galadriel. Canonical Third Age. | LOW |

### Note on Feanorian Lamp
"Feanorian" directly references Feanor, a First Age character. Options:
1. **"Jewel-lamp"**: Keeps the concept (lamp powered by lesser jewels) without First Age reference
2. **"Elven Lamp"**: More generic but clearly Elven
3. **"Noldor Lamp"**: Still references Noldor but less directly tied to Feanor

**Recommendation**: "Jewel-lamp" - descriptive, avoids First Age, maintains function.

| ID | OLD NAME | NEW NAME | Rationale | Refs |
|----|----------|----------|-----------|------|
| 116 | Arrow | **Arrow** | KEEP - Simple and universal. No change needed. | 7 |

### Alternative Consideration
- Could add variants like "Silvan Arrow", "Black Arrow" but base arrow should stay generic.

| Risk Level | Items | Notes |
|------------|-------|-------|
| MEDIUM | Boots, Gloves, Helm, Cloak | UI category strings in .c files |
| LOW | All others | Data files only |
