# Archery Proposal: Reworked Ability Tree

## Design Goals
1. Maintain strong stealth synergy (Ambush is excellent)
2. Replace mechanical Versatility with thematic ability
3. Keep the rest - tree is well-designed for Third Age

## Proposed Ability Tree

## Changes from Current

| Slot | Current | Proposed | Change Type |
|------|---------|----------|-------------|
| 0 | Rout | Rout | KEEP |
| 1 | Fletchery | Fletchery | KEEP |
| 2 | Point Blank Archery | Point Blank Archery | KEEP |
| 3 | Puncture | Puncture | KEEP |
| 4 | Ambush | Ambush | KEEP |
| 5 | Versatility | Keen Eyes | REPLACE |
| 6 | Crippling Shot | Crippling Shot | KEEP |
| 7 | Deadly Hail | Deadly Hail | KEEP |
| 8 | Dexterity | Dexterity | KEEP |

**Summary**: 8 KEEP, 1 REPLACE

The Archery tree is well-designed. Only Versatility needed replacement with more thematic Keen Eyes ability.
