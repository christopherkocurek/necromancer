## Hybrid Build Validation

Can players mix these effectively?

| Ranger-Duelist | Archery | Melee | YES - ranged then melee |
| Loremaster-Scout | Lore | Evasion | YES - bypass + escape |
| Warrior-Defender | Melee | Will | YES - synergistic |
| Assassin-Herbalist | Stealth | Lore | YES - sustainable stealth |

**All hybrids validated.**

## Conclusion

**VALIDATED**: 8 distinct archetypes emerge naturally from ability synergies.

Key design success factors:
1. No ability is too narrowly focused
2. Stealth synergies exist in all trees
3. Multiple paths to similar fantasies
4. Tolkien precedents for all archetypes

The system supports emergent character building without preset classes.
