## Perception Tree Assessment

The Perception tree is well-designed:
- Strong Tolkien precedents (Listen, Keen Senses, Alchemy, Bane)
- Good stealth synergy (Listen, Keen Senses, Focused Attack)
- Meaningful choices (Bane specialization, combat vs utility)

Only Quick Study feels mechanical, but it's valuable for build flexibility.

**Recommendation: Minimal changes - just rename Quick Study.**
