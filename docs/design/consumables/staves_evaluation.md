# Staves Evaluation
## The Necromancer - Consumables Audit

**Generated**: 2026-01-09
**Criteria**: Fun, Problem-Solving, Theme-Fit, Stealth-Synergy (1-5 scale)

## Current Design Note

Staves in Sil-Q are **utility devices**, not weapons. They use charges and are NOT wielded in combat. This differs from the Gandalf archetype where staves are both weapons and casting tools.

## Utility/Detection Staves

| Staff | Fun | Problem | Theme | Stealth | Total | Notes |
|-------|-----|---------|-------|---------|-------|-------|
| Light | 4 | 4 | 5 | 1 | **14** | Gandalf's light, but anti-stealth |
| Revelations | 4 | 5 | 3 | 5 | **17** | Essential mapping, great for stealth |
| Treasures | 3 | 4 | 2 | 4 | **13** | Useful, generic |
| Foes | 4 | 5 | 3 | 5 | **17** | Excellent for stealth planning |
| Understanding | 4 | 5 | 4 | 4 | **17** | Essential ID staff |
| Self Knowledge | 2 | 2 | 2 | 3 | **9** | Rarely needed |
| Freedom | 4 | 4 | 3 | 4 | **15** | Door/trap handling |

## Control Staves

| Staff | Fun | Problem | Theme | Stealth | Total | Notes |
|-------|-----|---------|-------|---------|-------|-------|
| Slumber | 5 | 5 | 4 | 5 | **19** | Excellent for stealth (sleep enemies) |
| Majesty | 4 | 4 | 5 | 3 | **16** | Fear is thematic (wizard presence) |
| Dismay | 4 | 4 | 3 | 2 | **13** | Confusion is chaotic |
| Imprisonment | 4 | 4 | 3 | 5 | **16** | Lock doors = great escape |
| Warding | 4 | 4 | 4 | 4 | **16** | Defensive, strategic |

## Utility Staves

| Staff | Fun | Problem | Theme | Stealth | Total | Notes |
|-------|-----|---------|-------|---------|-------|-------|
| Sanctity | 3 | 4 | 4 | 3 | **14** | Remove curses, necessary |
| Recharging | 3 | 4 | 3 | 3 | **13** | Meta-utility, enables other staves |

## Special Staves

| Staff | Fun | Problem | Theme | Stealth | Total | Notes |
|-------|-----|---------|-------|---------|-------|-------|
| Shadows | 5 | 4 | 5 | 5 | **19** | Excellent stealth tool, thematic |
| Summoning | 2 | 1 | 3 | 1 | **7** | Mostly harmful |

2. Shadows (19) - Excellent thematic stealth
3. Revelations (17) - Essential utility
4. Foes (17) - Essential detection
5. Understanding (17) - Essential ID

### Flagged for Improvement
1. Summoning (7) - Harmful, no clear use
2. Self Knowledge (9) - Rarely needed

---

## Stealth-Synergy Analysis

### Excellent Stealth Staves (5/5)
- **Slumber**: Put enemies to sleep, bypass encounters
- **Shadows**: Create darkness for hiding
- **Imprisonment**: Lock doors to block pursuit
- **Revelations**: Map without exploring
- **Foes**: Know where enemies are

### Anti-Stealth Staves (1-2/5)
- **Light**: Illuminates you to enemies
- **Summoning**: Brings more enemies

### Assessment
Staves have **excellent stealth integration** overall. The staff system supports stealth-first gameplay well.

---

## Theme Analysis

### Strong Tolkien Fit
| Staff | Reference |
|-------|-----------|
| Light | Gandalf's light in Moria |
| Shadows | Morgoth's darkness |
| Majesty | Wizard's presence/authority |
| Slumber | Gandalf putting dwarves to sleep |

### Generic Names (Rename Candidates)
| Current | Proposed | Rationale |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| Treasures | Dowsing | More mystical |
| Self Knowledge | Reflection | More evocative |
| Dismay | Confusion | Already accurate, or "Bewilderment" |

---

## Gandalf-Style Staff Analysis

### Current State
Staves are NOT weapons:
- No damage (P:0:0d0:0:0d0)
- Cannot be equipped in weapon slot
- Charge-based usage from inventory
- No combat role

### Gandalf Archetype
In Tolkien, Gandalf's staff is:
- A walking stick / polearm
- A magical focus
- A light source
- A combat implement (he fights with it)

### Hypothetical Rework: Combat Staves

**If staves became weapons:**

| Staff Type | Damage | Special | Charges |
|------------|--------|---------|---------|
| Staff of Light | 2d4 | Cast Light (3 charges) | Recharges |
| Staff of the Wise | 2d5 | ID items (5 charges) | Recharges |
| Shadow Staff | 2d4 | Cast Darkness (3 charges) | Recharges |
| Staff of Majesty | 2d6 | Fear aura (2 charges) | Recharges |

**Implementation Complexity**: HIGH
- Requires weapon slot changes
- Charge recharging on rest/time
- Balance with existing weapons
- New combat animations/logic

### Recommendation
Keep staves as utility devices for now. Combat staves would be a **major feature** requiring dedicated design work.

---

## Recommendations

### Keep As-Is (Working Well)
1. Slumber - Excellent
2. Shadows - Excellent
3. Revelations - Essential
4. Foes - Essential
5. Understanding - Essential
6. Majesty - Thematic
7. Imprisonment - Tactical
8. Warding - Strategic
9. Freedom - Utility

### Minor Improvements
10. Light - Add blind effect on light-sensitive enemies (may already exist)
11. Sanctity - Rename to "Purification" or "Blessing"
12. Recharging - Works, could have better name

### Rework
13. Summoning - Change to beneficial:
    - Option A: "Staff of Calling" - Summon allied creature
    - Option B: Remove entirely
    - Option C: Rename "Staff of Luring" - Pull enemies to you (tactical)

14. Self Knowledge - Make more useful:
    - Option A: Also shows hidden stats/abilities
    - Option B: Merge into Understanding
    - Option C: Remove (redundant with character screen)

### Add (To Fill Gaps)
15. **Staff of Speed** - Temporary haste
16. **Staff of Healing** - Emergency heal (rare, low charges)
17. **Staff of Teleportation** - Blink short distance (escape tool)

---

## Force of Will (Channeling) Integration

Current Channeling ability is excellent:
- 2x charge efficiency
- Auto-identify staves/horns
- Makes Will investment meaningful

**Recommendation**: Keep this system. Consider adding more staves to make Channeling even more valuable.
