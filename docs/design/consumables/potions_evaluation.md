## Recommendations

### Rename for Theme
| Current | Proposed | Rationale |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| Healing | Cordial of the Wise | Elvish healing reference |
| Strength | Draught of Might | More evocative |
| Dexterity | Nimble-wine | Connects to agility |
| Constitution | Hardy-brew | Dwarf-flavored |
| Grace | Starlight Elixir | Elvish grace |

### Harmful Potion Rework
Option A: **Remove after identification** (Brogue Lite approach)
Option B: **Add use case** - Make throwable as weapons
Option C: **Rename as Morgul-potions** - Stronger theme, tradeoff effects

### Add New Potions
1. **Potion of Shadows** - Temporary stealth boost (+5 perception evade)
2. **Ent-draught** - Rare, permanent +1 CON
3. **Pipe-weed Extract** - +Will, -Perception (smoke effect)

---

## Stealth-Focused Recommendations

Current stealth-synergy potions: Esgalduin, True Sight, Quickness, Grace

**Gap**: No potion that directly enhances hiding/evasion.

**Proposed**: Potion of Shadows
- Effect: +10 to stealth, enemies less likely to notice you
- Duration: 10d4 turns
- Depth: 8+
- Theme: "A dark liquid that makes your form harder to perceive"
