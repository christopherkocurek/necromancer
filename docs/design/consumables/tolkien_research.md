## Recommended Additions

### High Priority (Canonical, Fits Theme)

1. **Pipe-weed / Old Toby**
   - Effect: +Will, calm, -perception (smoke visible)

   - Very Tolkien-appropriate

2. **Cram**
   - Effect: Less nutrition than Lembas, heavier, more common
   - Fills gap for "normal" rations
   - Connects to Dale/Dwarf theme

### Medium Priority

3. **Ent-draught**
   - Effect: Temporary or permanent stat boost
   - Very rare (Ents are rare)
   - Could be quest reward only

4. **Morgul-draught**
   - Evil counterpart to healing
   - Harmful but with power boost
   - Fits Dol Guldur setting

### Low Priority

5. **Galenas (unprocessed)**
   - Raw form of pipe-weed
   - Could be ingredient for alchemy

## Design Principles from Tolkien

### Physical + Spiritual
Tolkien's consumables often have both physical and spiritual dimensions:
- Athelas heals body AND spirit
- Lembas sustains AND is repulsive to evil
- Miruvor warms AND restores hope

### Origin Matters
The source of an item affects its properties:
- Elvish items have spiritual components
- Númenórean items often have healing properties
- Evil items are effective but corrupting

### Contrast and Parody
Evil often creates corrupted versions:
- Orc-food vs Lembas
- Orc-draught vs Miruvor
- Morgul-blade poison vs Athelas healing
