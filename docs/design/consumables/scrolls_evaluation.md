# Horns Evaluation
## The Necromancer - Consumables Audit

**Generated**: 2026-01-09
**Criteria**: Fun, Problem-Solving, Theme-Fit, Stealth-Synergy (1-5 scale)

---

## Important Design Note

Sil-Q uses **HORNS** instead of scrolls. This is an excellent thematic choice - horns are canonical in Tolkien (Horn of Gondor, horns of Rohan) while scrolls are generic fantasy.

## Detailed Analysis

### Horn of Terror
- **Strengths**: Fear effect clears rooms, canonical (Boromir's horn struck fear)
- **Weaknesses**: Loud, anti-stealth
- **Keep**: Yes

### Horn of Thunder
- **Strengths**: Stun + damage, Helm Hammerhand reference
- **Weaknesses**: Very loud
- **Keep**: Yes

### Horn of Force
- **Strengths**: Knockback is unique, great escape tool
- **Weaknesses**: Loud
- **Keep**: Yes, consider as top-tier

### Horn of Blasting
- **Strengths**: Terrain destruction is unique and fun
- **Weaknesses**: Can damage player, very loud
- **Keep**: Yes, high skill ceiling

### Horn of Warning
- **Strengths**: Makes enemies aggressive (very niche use)
- **Weaknesses**: Mostly harmful, -40 perception penalty
- **Recommendation**: Rework or remove

---

## Stealth Interaction Design

### Intentional Tradeoff
All horns have terrible stealth synergy (1/5). This is **intentional good design**:
- Horns are emergency "oh no" buttons
- Using one reveals you completely
- Creates meaningful choice: survive now, deal with consequences

### Noise Penalties
| Horn | Perception Penalty | Assessment |
|------|-------------------|------------|
| Terror | -10 | Moderate |
| Thunder | -20 | Loud |
| Force | ~-15 | Loud |
| Blasting | ~-30 | Very loud |
| Warning | -40 | Extremely loud |

---

## Gaps Identified

### Missing Horn Types
1. **Utility horns** - All current horns are combat-focused
2. **Healing/buff horn** - No "Horn of Valour" type
3. **Stealth horn** - Could have "muffled" horn with smaller effect

### Proposed Additions

#### Horn of Rallying
- Effect: Cures fear, temporary +1 Will for player
- Noise: -5 (quieter than other horns)
- Theme: Signal horn for companions
- Problem solved: Fear is crippling, need counter

#### Horn of Mist
- Effect: Creates fog in area (blocks line of sight)
- Noise: -10
- Theme: Mysterious, otherworldly
- Problem solved: Escape when surrounded
- Stealth synergy: Creates cover for hiding

## Comparison with Scroll-Based Systems

| Aspect | Horns (Sil-Q) | Scrolls (Traditional) |
|--------|---------------|----------------------|
| Theme | Excellent (Tolkien) | Generic (D&D) |
| Variety | Low (5 types) | High (15+ types) |
| Use Pattern | Emergency | Regular |
| Stealth | Anti-stealth | Mixed |
| Skill | None | Sometimes magic skill |

### Assessment
Horns are more thematic but less varied. Consider adding 2-3 more horns rather than switching to scrolls.

---

## Recommendations

### Keep
1. Terror - Core panic button
2. Thunder - Stun utility
3. Force - Best escape horn
4. Blasting - Unique terrain interaction

### Rework
5. Warning - Change to buff effect or remove
   - Option A: "Horn of Challenge" - Taunts enemies but grants temporary combat bonus
   - Option B: Remove entirely

### Add
6. Horn of Rallying - Fear cure + buff
7. Horn of Mist - Stealth escape option
