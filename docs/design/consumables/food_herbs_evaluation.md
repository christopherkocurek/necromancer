## Theme Analysis

### Strong Tolkien Fit
- **Athelas**: Kingsfoil, canonical healing herb
- **Lembas**: Elvish waybread, canonical

### Missing Tolkien Items
| Item | Description | Suggested Implementation |
|------|-------------|-------------------------|
| Cram | Dale waybread | Like Lembas but heavier, more common |
| Ent-draught | Invigorating Ent drink | Rare, stat boost |
| Pipe-weed | Old Toby, calming | +Will, creates smoke (anti-stealth?) |
| Galenas | Wild pipe-weed | Ingredient for alchemy |

### Generic Names (Rename Candidates)
- Healing → Healer's Herb
- Restoration → Dúnedain Remedy
- Sustenance → Waymeal
- Rage → Orc-grass (or berserker mushroom)

---

## Stealth-Synergy Analysis

### Current Stealth-Positive Herbs
1. Athelas (4) - Quiet to use, cures conditions
2. Sustenance (4) - Quiet, practical
3. Healing (4) - Emergency recovery

### Stealth-Negative Herbs
1. Rage (1) - Berserking is loud, attracts attention

### Gap Identified
No herb specifically enhances stealth. Consider:
- **Nightshade** - +5 stealth, vision in darkness, poison risk
- **Shadow-moss** - Blend into darkness, only works in dim light

---

## Harmful Herb Recommendations

### Option A: Remove After ID
Following Brogue Lite, remove pure-negative herbs from drop pool after first identification.

### Option B: Add Use Case
Make harmful herbs throwable or convertible:
- Weakness → Poison for weapons
- Emptiness → Alchemical ingredient
- Sickness → Trap component

### Option C: Rename as Dark Herbs
Embrace the evil theme:
- Weakness → Morgul-root
- Sickness → Blight-weed
- Add cursed/shadow flavor text

| 2x Herb of Healing | Concentrated Healing | Heal 75% |

### Complex Combinations

| Lembas + Ent-draught | Waybread of Growth | +1 permanent CON |
