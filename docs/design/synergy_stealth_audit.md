# Stealth Synergy Audit: Alpha 0.3.0

## Design Principle

"Stealth is core, not optional. Every build should invest ~5 points."

This audit verifies every skill tree has meaningful stealth synergies.

---

## Stealth Tree (Core)

The foundation. Every character should take some of these:

| Ability | Stealth Value |
|---------|---------------|
| Disguise | Reduced monster memory of you |
| Assassination | +2 melee dice on sleeping/unwary |
| Disorienting Strike | Crits confuse, enemies lose track |
| Escape Artist | Break free, traps don't alert |
| Light Fingers | Steal from unwary enemies |
| Vanish | Disappear from sight, break pursuit |
| Deft Hands | Quieter, faster lockpicking |

**Status: CORE TREE - Excellent**

---

## Melee Tree

| Ability | Stealth Synergy |
|---------|-----------------|
| Opening Strike | +1 die on first attack vs unwary/sleeping |
| Defensive Stance | Hold ground after detection |
| Rapid Recovery | Quick recovery enables re-engagement |

**Status: GOOD** - Opening Strike rewards stealth ambushes

---

## Archery Tree

| Ability | Stealth Synergy |
|---------|-----------------|
| Precision | +1 die on first shot (ambush) |

---

## Lore Tree

| Lore of Silence | Dampen nearby sounds - CORE |
| Lore of Sleep | Put enemies to sleep - BYPASS |
| Word of Shutting | Seal doors - BLOCK PURSUIT |

## Summary

| Tree | Stealth Rating | Notes |
|------|----------------|-------|
| Stealth | CORE | Foundation for all builds |
| Lore | EXCELLENT | 4 stealth abilities |
| Evasion | EXCELLENT | Escape and positioning |
| Melee | GOOD | Opening Strike rewards ambush |
| Archery | GOOD | Precision rewards ambush |
| Perception | GOOD | Planning and awareness |
| Will | ADEQUATE | Defensive when stealth fails |
| Smithing | INDIRECT | Equipment support |

## Conclusion

**VALIDATED**: Every tree has meaningful stealth synergies.

The design principle "stealth is core" is well-supported:
- 2 trees with EXCELLENT stealth synergy (Lore, Evasion)
- 3 trees with GOOD stealth synergy (Melee, Archery, Perception)
- 1 tree with defensive backup (Will)
- 1 tree with indirect support (Smithing)

A character investing 5 points in Stealth plus abilities from other trees can build a coherent stealth-capable character regardless of primary focus.
