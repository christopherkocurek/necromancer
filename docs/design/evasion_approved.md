2. **Sprinting**: Escape after being detected
3. **Controlled Retreat**: Deal damage while withdrawing from failed stealth
4. **Dodging**: Survive combat after stealth breaks
5. **Leaping**: Mobility for infiltration routes

## Design Notes

The Evasion tree exemplifies good skill tree design:

1. **Branching paths**: Mobile (Dodging) vs Defensive (Blocking)
2. **Clear trade-offs**: Movement vs standing still
3. **Multiple playstyles**: Light mobile vs heavy tank
4. **Good prereq chains**: Abilities build logically
5. **Stealth integration**: Natural synergies without forcing
