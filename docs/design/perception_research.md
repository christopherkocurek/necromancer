- Aragorn tracking across rocky terrain for days
- Legolas seeing leagues distant
- Gandalf identifying the One Ring

### What DOESN'T Happen

## Stealth Synergies

Perception supports stealth by:
1. **Listen** - Know where enemies are to avoid them
2. **Keen Senses** - Detect before being detected
3. **Awareness** - Know when you've been spotted

## Current Perception Tree Analysis

1. Quick Study - Bypass prereqs (meta ability)
2. Focused Attack - +Per/2 if passed last turn
3. Keen Senses - See beyond light, +5 vs invisible
4. Concentration - +1 atk per round vs same enemy
5. Alchemy - Identify potions/herbs/staves/horns
6. Bane - Bonus vs selected enemy type
7. Outwit - Negate crits with Per roll
8. Listen - Detect unseen enemies
9. Master Hunter - +1 atk per kill of same type
10. Grace - +1 Gra

**Assessment**: Mixed bag. Some very thematic (Listen, Keen Senses, Alchemy), some mechanical (Quick Study, Concentration).
