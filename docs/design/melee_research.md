# Melee Research: Third Age Precedents

## Third Age Warriors and Their Deeds

### Aragorn (Ranger of the North, King Elessar)
- **Weathertop**: Fought off five Nazgul with torch and sword, driving them back
- **Moria**: Led fighting retreat through orc hordes
- **Amon Hen**: Slew many Uruk-hai in desperate defense of the hobbits
- **Helm's Deep**: Fought on the walls and in sorties, veteran swordsman
- **Pelennor Fields**: Led the Grey Company, fought through enemy lines
- **Black Gate**: Stood against overwhelming odds

*Techniques implied*: Defensive fighting, fighting retreats, facing multiple enemies, inspiring leadership, torch-and-sword fighting

### Boromir (Captain of Gondor)
- **Moria**: Front-line fighter against orcs
- **Amon Hen**: Last stand against Uruk-hai, slew many before falling

*Techniques implied*: Shield combat, horn use for rallying, fighting to the death, taking wounds but continuing

### Gimli (Dwarf of Erebor)
- **Moria**: Axe-work in close corridors
- **Helm's Deep**: 42 kills (vs Legolas's 41), fought in the caves
- **Pelennor Fields**: Side by side with Legolas

*Techniques implied*: Axe mastery, close-quarters combat, endurance fighting, competition/focus

### Eomer (Third Marshal of Riddermark)
- **Pelennor Fields**: Cavalry charges, dismounted combat
- **Led eored** against orcs throughout Rohan

*Techniques implied*: Mounted combat (not in game), spear charges, rallying men

### Theoden (King of Rohan)
- **Helm's Deep**: Led sortie from the gates
- **Pelennor Fields**: Death charge that broke the Haradrim

*Techniques implied*: Mounted charges, leading from front, fighting despite age

### Faramir (Captain of the Rangers of Ithilien)
- **Henneth Annun**: Ambush tactics, strategic retreat
- **Osgiliath**: Defense and fighting withdrawal
- **Pelennor Fields**: Wounded leading retreat

*Techniques implied*: Defensive fighting, ambush tactics, strategic thinking

### Imrahil (Prince of Dol Amroth)
- **Pelennor Fields**: Knight of great prowess
- **Rescued Eowyn and Theoden** from the field

*Techniques implied*: Elite swordsmanship, rescue operations, knightly combat

### Halbarad and the Rangers of the North
- **Grey Company**: Veteran wilderness fighters
- **Black Gate**: Dunedain fighting to the end

*Techniques implied*: Endurance, fighting against odds, sword and bow combination

## Combat Techniques Mentioned or Implied

### Offensive Techniques
1. **Charge** - Cavalry and infantry charges described (Helm's Deep, Pelennor)
2. **Follow-through attacks** - Aragorn clearing through orcs suggests continuous strikes
3. **Controlled aggression** - Rangers fight efficiently, not wildly
4. **Shield bash/knock back** - Implied in formation fighting

### Defensive Techniques
1. **Parrying** - Implied in all sword duels
2. **Shield blocking** - Boromir, Gondorian soldiers
3. **Fighting retreat** - Faramir at Osgiliath, Fellowship in Moria
4. **Holding position** - Helm's Deep wall defense

### Tactical Techniques
1. **Flanking** - Rangers use terrain and positioning
2. **Formation fighting** - Gondorian military training
3. **Ambush** - Faramir's specialty
4. **Last stand** - Boromir at Amon Hen

## Power Ceiling Examples

### Maximum Feats (Third Age cap)
- Aragorn defeating 5 Nazgul temporarily (not killing) with fire
- Boromir slaying "at least twenty" Uruk-hai before falling
- Gimli's 42 kills at Helm's Deep over a night of battle
- Imrahil's rescue on the Pelennor

### What DOESN'T Happen
- No single warrior defeating armies
- No supernatural combat abilities
- No cleaving through dozens in a single swing
- No defeating Nazgul in fair combat (only driving them off)

## Stealth Synergies to Consider

1. **Ranger-style fighting** - Aragorn combines stealth approach with deadly first strike
2. **Ambush into melee** - Faramir's tactics
3. **Assassination** - Already exists (Stealth tree)
4. **Surprise attack bonus** - First strike advantage

## Recommendations for Melee Tree

### Keep (Good Third Age fit)
- Charge (cavalry/infantry charges are canon)
- Knock Back (shield work, strength)
- Follow-Through (Aragorn clearing rooms)
- Parry-type abilities (sword dueling)
- Zone of Control (formation fighting)

### Question (May be too powerful)
- Whirlwind Attack - One person attacking all adjacent seems First Age
- Smite - Maximum damage feels mythic
- Rapid Attack - Extra attacks may push beyond ceiling

### Add Possibilities
- Defensive Stance - Holding ground (Helm's Deep wall)
- Shield Wall - Formation bonus (Gondorian tactics)
- Stealth Strike - Bonus from stealth approach (Ranger tactics)
- Endurance Fighting - Stamina over long battles (Gimli, Aragorn)
