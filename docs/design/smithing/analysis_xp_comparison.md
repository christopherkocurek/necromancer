## Overview

This document compares the value of XP invested in Smithing versus combat skills (Melee, Evasion, Will) to determine if Smithing is competitive as a primary skill investment.

## XP Budget Framework

### Typical Game XP Available

Based on XP Balance PRD (with +30% boost):

| Depth Range | XP Available |
|-------------|--------------|
| 0-300ft | ~4,000 XP |
| 0-500ft | ~8,000 XP |
| 0-700ft | ~13,000 XP |
| 0-1000ft | ~20,000 XP |
| Full game | ~25,000-30,000 XP |

### Investment Philosophy

**Combat builds:** Front-load combat skills for survival
**Smith builds:** Delay combat for crafting power
**Hybrid builds:** Balance between both

## Build Comparison: 10,000 XP Budget

### Pure Combat Build

| Skill | Level | XP Cost |
|-------|-------|---------|
| Melee | 8 | 3,600 |
| Evasion | 6 | 2,100 |
| Will | 4 | 1,000 |
| Perception | 3 | 600 |
| Abilities | - | 2,700 |
| **Total** | - | **10,000** |

**Combat effectiveness:** HIGH
- Strong melee damage and accuracy
- Decent evasion for survival
- Fear resistance from Will
- Found items only for gear

### Pure Smith Build

| Skill | Level | XP Cost |
|-------|-------|---------|
| Smithing | 8 | 3,600 |
| Smith abilities | - | 3,500 |
| Melee | 4 | 1,000 |
| Evasion | 4 | 1,000 |
| Perception | 2 | 300 |
| Combat abilities | - | 600 |
| **Total** | - | **10,000** |

**Combat effectiveness:** MEDIUM
- Low melee and evasion limits direct combat
- Crafted gear compensates partially
- Requires forge access to shine
- Artifacts via Masterwork can be game-changing

### Hybrid Build (Recommended)

| Skill | Level | XP Cost |
|-------|-------|---------|
| Melee | 6 | 2,100 |
| Evasion | 5 | 1,500 |
| Smithing | 5 | 1,500 |
| Smith abilities | - | 1,250 |
| Will | 3 | 600 |
| Combat abilities | - | 2,050 |
| **Total** | - | **9,000** |

**Combat effectiveness:** MEDIUM-HIGH
- Solid combat foundation
- Reforge access for enchanted items
- Best of both worlds
- Flexible gear options

---

## Direct Comparison: 1,000 XP Investment

### Option A: Melee 4 → 6

**Cost:** 1,100 XP (500 + 600)
**Benefit:**

- Access to level 5-6 abilities
- Immediate combat improvement

**Value per XP:** HIGH - Direct combat effectiveness

### Option B: Smithing 4 → 6 (with Reforge + Expertise)

**Cost:** ~2,350 XP (500 + 600 + abilities)
**Benefit:**
- Reforge access (enchanted items)
- Expertise (no XP/stat costs)
- Future cost elimination

**Value per XP:** MEDIUM-HIGH - Delayed but compounding returns

### Option C: Evasion 4 → 6

**Cost:** 1,100 XP
**Benefit:**
- +10% evasion
- Access to defensive abilities
- Immediate survival improvement

**Value per XP:** HIGH - Direct survival improvement

## Time-Value Analysis

### Combat Investment

**When it pays off:** Immediately
**Risk:** None - always useful
**Ceiling:** Limited by found gear quality

### Smithing Investment

**When it pays off:** After finding forge + broken items
**Risk:** May not find required materials
**Ceiling:** Much higher with artifact creation

### Break-Even Point

For Smithing to match Combat value:

| Investment | Break-Even Requirement |
|------------|----------------------|
| Smithing 5 (Reforge) | Create 1-2 enchanted items |
| Smithing 7 (Reclaim) | Create 1 artifact |
| Smithing 8 (Masterwork) | Create 1 top-tier artifact |

**Typical game:** Players can achieve break-even by mid-game

---

## Scenario Analysis

### Scenario 1: Perfect Forge Access

**Conditions:** Find forge at 100', 300', 500' (guaranteed)
**Smithing value:** MAXIMUM
- Can use all forge abilities
- Multiple crafting opportunities
- Artifacts become reliable

### Scenario 2: Limited Forge Access

**Conditions:** Only find 1-2 forges total
**Smithing value:** REDUCED
- Fewer crafting opportunities
- May not reach Reclaim/Masterwork
- Combat investment safer

### Scenario 3: No Broken Items

**Conditions:** Bad luck with drops
**Smithing value:** MINIMUM
- Reforge/Reclaim/Masterwork useless
- Base item creation only
- Combat would have been better

---

## Risk-Adjusted Value

### Combat Skills: Low Risk, Medium Reward

- **Probability of value:** 100%
- **Expected return:** Reliable improvement
- **Variance:** Low
- **Risk score:** ★☆☆☆☆

### Smithing: Medium Risk, High Reward

- **Probability of value:** ~80% (requires materials)
- **Expected return:** Potentially game-changing
- **Variance:** High
- **Risk score:** ★★★☆☆

### Hybrid: Low Risk, Medium-High Reward

- **Probability of value:** ~95%
- **Expected return:** Good improvement + crafting option
- **Variance:** Medium
- **Risk score:** ★★☆☆☆

## XP Efficiency Metrics

### Per-Point Combat Value

| Skill | XP per Point | Combat Value |
|-------|--------------|--------------|
| Melee 1 | 100 | +10% hit |
| Melee 5 | 500 | +10% hit |
| Melee 10 | 1000 | +10% hit |
| Evasion 1 | 100 | +5% evade |
| Evasion 5 | 500 | +5% evade |
| Evasion 10 | 1000 | +5% evade |

**Observation:** Diminishing returns per XP at higher levels

### Per-Point Smithing Value

| Investment | XP Cost | Value |
|------------|---------|-------|
| Weaponsmith | ~800 | Create weapons |
| Reforge | ~2,750 | 500 XP → enchanted item |
| Reclaim | ~4,550 | 500 XP → artifact |
| Masterwork | ~5,600 | 1000 XP → best artifact |

**Observation:** Front-loaded cost, back-loaded value

## Conclusions

### When to Prioritize Combat

1. **Early game (0-300ft):** Survival is paramount
2. **Risky builds:** Need reliability
3. **Speed runs:** No time for crafting
4. **Bad RNG:** No forges or materials available

### When to Prioritize Smithing

1. **Mid-game (300-700ft):** Guaranteed forges available
2. **Long games:** More time to realize value
3. **Specific build goals:** Need particular item types
4. **Found broken items:** Can capitalize on Reforge/Reclaim

### Optimal Strategy

1. **Levels 0-300ft:** Minimum combat (Melee 4, Evasion 4)
2. **Level 100ft forge:** Get Weaponsmith, create first weapon
3. **Levels 300-500ft:** Evaluate broken item drops
4. **If good drops:** Invest in Reforge (Smithing 5)
5. **If great drops:** Invest in Reclaim (Smithing 7)
6. **Beyond 500ft:** Combat skills catch up

---

## Recommendations

### For Balance Design

1. **Reduce early Smithing ability costs** - Lower barrier to hybrid builds
2. **Guarantee broken item drops** - Remove RNG from Smithing value
3. **Add high-level combat equivalence** - Make Smithing 15-20 as valuable as combat skills

### For Players

| Build Type | Recommended Smithing |
|------------|---------------------|
| Warrior | 0-2 (skip it) |
| Archer | 4-5 (jewelry, Reforge) |
| Stealth | 5-7 (custom gear, Reclaim) |
| Dedicated Smith | 8-10 (Masterwork, Grace) |
| Master Smith | 12-20 (if new abilities added) |

### For XP Allocation

**First 5,000 XP:** Establish combat baseline
**Next 3,000 XP:** Evaluate Smithing opportunity
**Remaining XP:** Specialize based on game state
