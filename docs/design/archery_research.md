# Archery Research: Third Age Precedents

## Third Age Archers and Their Deeds

### Legolas (Prince of Mirkwood)
- **Fellowship**: Shot Nazgul's fell beast at night over Anduin
- **Moria**: Rapid shooting in orc battle
- **Helm's Deep**: 41 kills in the night battle
- **Pelennor Fields**: Countless kills, shot mumakil's eyes

*Techniques implied*: Extreme accuracy, rapid fire, shooting in darkness, shooting from walls, targeting weak points

### Bard the Bowman (Lake-town)
- **Smaug**: Killed the dragon with a single black arrow to the weak spot
- Identified the weakness and made a precision shot under pressure

*Techniques implied*: Identifying weakness, calm under pressure, legendary single shot

### Rangers of the North (Dunedain)
- **Ambush tactics**: Hidden bowmen striking first
- Combined stealth and archery

*Techniques implied*: Ambush shooting, stealth approach, first-strike advantage

### Rangers of Ithilien (Faramir's company)
- **Henneth Annun**: Ambush of Haradrim column
- Hidden positions, coordinated volleys

*Techniques implied*: Ambush, volley fire, hit-and-run tactics

### Mirkwood Elves
- **Barrel escape**: Shot at escaping dwarves (hostile)
- Forest hunting, spider fighting

*Techniques implied*: Woodland archery, rapid target acquisition

### Beorn's People / Woodmen
- Hunting bows for game
- Simpler, less martial archery

*Techniques implied*: Hunting, practical archery

## Archery Techniques Mentioned or Implied

### Offensive Techniques
1. **Rapid Fire** - Legolas at Helm's Deep implies multiple arrows quickly
2. **Precision Shots** - Bard's black arrow, Legolas shooting eyes
3. **Ambush Shooting** - Rangers' primary tactic
4. **Shooting at Range** - Elven eyes see farther
5. **Shooting Moving Targets** - Hunting, combat

### Tactical Techniques
1. **Ambush** - Already in Archery tree (synergy with Stealth)
2. **Rout** - Shooting fleeing enemies (already in tree)
3. **Suppression** - Keeping enemies pinned

### Special Situations
1. **Point Blank** - When melee closes in
2. **Darkness/Poor Light** - Elven night vision
3. **Fletcher Work** - Making/improving arrows

## Power Ceiling Examples

### Maximum Feats (Third Age cap)
- Bard killing Smaug (one perfect shot to known weakness)
- Legolas's 41 kills at Helm's Deep over a night
- Legolas shooting a Nazgul's mount in darkness

### What DOESN'T Happen
- No magic arrows (except black arrow heirloom)
- No hitting multiple enemies with one arrow
- No supernatural guidance
- No infinite ammunition

## Stealth Synergies (Already Strong)

1. **Ambush** - Already exists, perfect stealth synergy
2. **Rout** - Shooting fleeing enemies after ambush
3. **First Shot** - Hidden archer gets critical opener

## Recommendations for Archery Tree

### Keep (Good Third Age fit)
- Rout (fleeing enemies)
- Fletchery (practical craft)
- Point Blank Archery (melee defense)
- Puncture (armor penetration)
- Ambush (core stealth synergy!)
- Crippling Shot (disabling enemies)
- Deadly Hail (momentum after kills)

### Question
- Versatility (archery bonus to melee) - Mechanical, not thematic

### Add Possibilities
- **Keen Eyes** - Better accuracy at range (Elven sight)
- **Called Shot** - Targeting specific body parts (Bard's technique)
- **Covering Fire** - Supporting allies with suppression
