# Lore Tree Proposal: No Changes Required

## Summary

After thorough audit against Third Age design principles, the Lore tree requires **no changes**. It is the best-designed tree in the game.

## Audit Results

All 14 abilities passed the four-question audit:

| Ability | Tolkien | Power Scale | Stealth Hook | Interesting |
|---------|---------|-------------|--------------|-------------|
| Word of Command | Gandalf's voice | Grounded | Fear = escape | Area fear |
| Lore of Battle | Tactical knowledge | Grounded | Position control | Tactical |
| Deep Memory | Ancestral memory | Grounded | Know paths | Exploration |
| Word of Opening | "Mellon" at Moria | Grounded | Silent access | Key utility |
| Lore of Silence | Elven quiet | Grounded | CORE STEALTH | Essential |
| Herbcraft | Aragorn/athelas | Grounded | Quiet healing | Sustain |
| Word of Shutting | Words of warding | Grounded | Block pursuit | Tactical |
| Inner Light | Gandalf's staff | Grounded | Trade-off | Vision/stealth |
| Deadly Lore | Anatomical knowledge | Grounded | Clean kills | Combat |
| Lore of Endurance | Mental techniques | Grounded | Survive detection | Defensive |
| Lore of Sleep | Elven sleep-songs | Grounded | BYPASS ENEMIES | Essential |
| Word of Mastery | Saruman's voice | Borderline | Freeze to escape | Powerful |
| Device Mastery | Gandalf's powers | Grounded | Combine effects | Capstone |
| Grace | N/A | Grounded | N/A | Stat reward |

## Stealth Synergies (Exemplary)

The Lore tree demonstrates how stealth should integrate into non-stealth trees:

1. **Lore of Silence** (N:144) - Dampen nearby sounds, harder for enemies to hear
   - CORE stealth synergy for loremaster builds

2. **Lore of Sleep** (N:150) - Put nearby enemies to sleep
   - Non-combat solution, bypass enemies entirely

3. **Word of Shutting** (N:146) - Seal doors to bar enemy passage
   - Block pursuit after detection

## Why No Changes?

1. **Strong Tolkien Precedent**: Every ability traces to Middle-earth lore
2. **Grounded Power Scale**: Words of power, not flashy magic
3. **Multiple Stealth Hooks**: 3 abilities directly support stealth play
4. **Clear Fantasy**: "Wise scholar with words of power"
5. **Good Progression**: Utility -> Combat -> Crowd Control -> Capstone

## Recommendation

**KEEP ALL 14 ABILITIES UNCHANGED**

The Lore tree should be the template for future ability design.
