## Evasion Tree Assessment

The Evasion tree is excellently designed for Third Age:
- All abilities have clear Tolkien precedents
- Good stealth synergies exist (Flanking, Sprinting, Controlled Retreat)
- Nice trade-offs between mobility (Dodging) and defense (Blocking)
- Alternative playstyles supported (Heavy Armor vs Light/Mobile)

**Recommendation: Keep entire tree unchanged.**
