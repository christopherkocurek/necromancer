# Monsters

## Overview

The creatures of Dol Guldur are organized by the tier where they primarily appear. Each tier introduces new threats and mechanics.

## Monster Mechanics

### Alertness
Some monsters can alert others to your presence:
- **Crebain** - If they escape the level, alertness increases significantly
- **Orc Scouts** - Wake nearby sleeping enemies
- **Giant Bats** - Screech wakes nearby enemies

### Pack Tactics
Wargs and some other creatures gain bonuses when fighting alongside allies of the same type.

### Undead Properties
Undead creatures:
- Don't sleep (can't be ambushed)
- May be immune to certain effects (poison, fear)
- Often vulnerable to holy effects and light
- Skeletons take extra damage from blunt weapons

### Fear Auras
Powerful creatures like Nazgûl project fear. You must pass Will checks to:
- Approach them
- Remain in their presence
- Attack them

### Special Immunities
- **Nazgûl** - Immune to normal weapons; require magical, silver, or artifact weapons
- **Phantoms** - 50% chance physical attacks pass through (incorporeal)
