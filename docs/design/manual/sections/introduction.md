# The Necromancer

## About The Necromancer

The Necromancer is a tactical roguelike game set in Tolkien's Third Age of Middle-earth. Forked from the excellent Sil-Q project, it places you in Dol Guldur during the dark years when Sauron, disguised as "The Necromancer," claimed his tower in southern Mirkwood.

Like its predecessor, The Necromancer emphasizes tactical depth over grinding. Every encounter matters, every choice has consequences, and death is permanent. This is not a game where you can outlevel your problems—you must outthink them.

## Who Will Enjoy This Game

The Necromancer is designed for players who enjoy:

- **Tactical combat** where positioning and timing matter more than stats
- **Meaningful character builds** with real tradeoffs
- **High stakes gameplay** with permanent death
- **Stealth and cunning** as viable alternatives to combat
- **Rich lore** set in Tolkien's Middle-earth

If you've enjoyed Sil, Sil-Q, Angband, or other traditional roguelikes, you'll find familiar mechanics here with a fresh setting and some new twists.

## The Setting

### Third Age, Year 2850

The shadow over Mirkwood deepens. For five years, Thráin son of Thrór, King of Durin's Folk, has languished in the dungeons of Dol Guldur, his mind broken by the Necromancer's torments.

Dol Guldur—the "Hill of Dark Sorcery"—rises in southern Mirkwood on Amon Lanc, once the capital of the Silvan Elves before Sauron's shadow fell upon it. Now it serves as the Necromancer's fortress, filled with orcs, trolls, giant spiders, and darker things.

### Your Quest

You have been chosen for a desperate mission: descend into the Hill of Dark Sorcery, find the dying dwarf-king, and recover what he carries—the last of the Seven Dwarf-rings and the key to Erebor.

Few who enter Dol Guldur return. None who have seen its deepest pits have escaped to tell the tale.

Until now.

## The Basics

### Goal

Your primary objective is to:
1. Descend through Dol Guldur's depths (to 1000 feet)
2. Find Thráin in the Pits of Despair
3. Recover the Ring of Thráin and the Key to Erebor
4. Escape back to the surface while Sauron pursues you

### Core Gameplay Loop

1. **Descend** through procedurally generated dungeon levels
2. **Fight or Avoid** the creatures that inhabit each tier
3. **Gather Equipment** to improve your chances of survival
4. **Develop Skills** by earning experience through exploration and combat
5. **Reach the Bottom** and claim your objective
6. **Escape** back to the surface in a desperate chase

### Permadeath

When your character dies, they are gone forever. This is not a bug—it's the core of the roguelike experience. Each run teaches you more about the game's systems, making your next character more likely to succeed.

Save your game when you need to stop playing, but know that loading a save resumes the game exactly where you left off. There is no "save scumming" in The Necromancer.

## Notes for Sil-Q Players

If you're coming from Sil-Q, here are the key changes:

| Sil-Q | The Necromancer |
|-------|-----------------|
| First Age setting | Third Age setting |
| Angband (Morgoth's fortress) | Dol Guldur (Sauron's fortress) |
| Retrieve a Silmaril | Retrieve Ring + Key from Thráin |
| Song magic system | Lore magic system |
| Noldor/Sindar/Naugrim/Edain | Elf/Man/Dwarf with Third Age houses |
| Escape after stealing Silmaril | Escape while Sauron pursues |

The core mechanics—combat, stealth, stats, skills—remain largely the same. The setting, lore abilities, and endgame structure are the main differences.
