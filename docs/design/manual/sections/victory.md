# Victory Conditions

## Overview

There are two ways to win The Necromancer:
1. **Escape Victory** - Retrieve the Ring and Key, escape to the surface
2. **Banishment Victory** - Banish Sauron with the Rod of the Istari

Both are legitimate victories. Escape Victory is the standard path; Banishment Victory is the challenging alternative.

## Escape Victory (Standard)

### Requirements
1. Descend to depth 1000 ft (the Pits of Despair)
2. Find Thráin's prison cell
3. Take the Ring of Thráin and Key to Erebor
4. Return to the surface (depth 0)

### The Journey Down

Your descent through Dol Guldur takes you through four tiers of increasing danger:

| Tier | Depth | Challenge |
|------|-------|-----------|
| The Outer Pits | 50-250 ft | Spiders, orcs, wargs |
| The Dark Halls | 250-500 ft | Trolls, undead, sorcerers |
| The Necropolis | 500-750 ft | Wraiths, vampires, Nazgûl |
| The Inner Sanctum | 750-1000 ft | Sauron's domain |

### Finding Thráin

Thráin II, King of Durin's Folk, is imprisoned in the Pits of Despair at 1000 ft. He has been tortured for five years and is dying.

When you find him:
- He is mentally broken and cannot be saved
- He will give you (or you will take from his body) the Ring and Key
- His death is inevitable—this is not a choice you can prevent

### Taking the Ring

The moment you take the Ring of Thráin and Key to Erebor, **Pursuit Mode** begins.

### Pursuit Mode

When you take the Ring:

**Sauron Awakens**
- Sauron appears in his throne room
- He begins pursuing you through the dungeon
- He always knows your general location (Lidless Eye)

**The Dungeon Changes**
- New enemies spawn on all floors
- Some staircases become locked
- Some areas collapse, blocking routes
- Hidden shortcuts open up

**The Chase**
- Sauron moves toward you each turn (slower but relentless)
- You cannot kill him through normal means
- You must outrun him to the surface

**The Ring's Burden**
- The Ring of Thráin is cursed with Gold Hallucination
- You see fake gold piles everywhere
- Must pass Will checks or waste turns chasing mirages
- Higher Will = fewer hallucinations

**Exhaustion**
- Every 5 floors ascended: -1 to a random stat temporarily
- The Ring weighs on its bearer
- Stats restore upon victory

### Reaching the Surface

If you reach depth 0 (the surface) while carrying the Ring and Key, you win.

You have escaped Dol Guldur with the treasures of Thráin. The Key will eventually reach the dwarves, leading to the Quest of Erebor. The Ring's fate... is another story.

## Banishment Victory (Hard)

### Requirements
1. Find both pieces of the Broken Staff
2. Assemble the Rod of the Istari at a forge
3. Achieve Lore 12+ and Will 10+
4. Confront Sauron in his throne room
5. Win the Banishment contest

### Finding the Broken Staff

The Rod of the Istari was broken long ago. Its pieces are hidden in Dol Guldur:

| Piece | Location | Stats |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Broken Staff (Upper) | Tier 2 vault (~400 ft) | +2 Lore, +1 Will |
| Broken Staff (Lower) | Tier 3 (~700 ft) | +2 Lore, +1 Grace |

Both pieces function as weapons and provide bonuses while carried.

### Assembling the Rod

At any **forge** (found in Tier 2 and deeper), with both pieces in your inventory, you can assemble the Rod of the Istari.

**Rod of the Istari**
- +5 Lore
- +3 Will
- Enables the Banishment ability

### The Banishment

With the Rod assembled and sufficient skills (Lore 12+, Will 10+), you can confront Sauron directly.

**Banishment Action**:
1. Must be in same room as Sauron
2. Use the Banishment ability (costs your full turn)
3. Contested Will check: your Will vs Sauron's Will

**Success**:
- Sauron is banished from his physical form
- He cannot pursue you
- You can loot his throne room freely
- Take the Ring and Key at your leisure
- Return to surface without Pursuit Mode

**Failure**:
- The Rod of the Istari is destroyed
- You take massive damage
- Sauron is enraged
- You must escape normally (now without the Rod's bonuses)

### Why Attempt Banishment?

**Advantages**:
- No Pursuit Mode means easier escape
- Can explore Tier 4 thoroughly
- Additional loot from throne room
- Greater glory in the scoring system

**Disadvantages**:
- Requires finding both staff pieces
- Requires Lore 12+ and Will 10+ (significant investment)
- Failure is catastrophic
- Sauron is immensely powerful

## Defeat Conditions

You lose if:
- Your HP reaches 0
- Certain instant-death effects (rare)
- Sauron catches you during Pursuit Mode with no escape

## Tips for Victory

### Escape Victory
1. **Speed matters** - Don't clear every room; move with purpose
2. **High Will helps** - Resists Ring hallucinations and Sauron's gaze
3. **Map escape routes** - Note hidden passages on the way down
4. **Stock supplies** - Healing and teleportation for the escape

### Banishment Victory
1. **Prioritize Lore** - Need 12 for the check
2. **Don't neglect Will** - Need 10 for the check
3. **Find the staff pieces early** - They give bonuses while carried
4. **Consider backup plan** - If Banishment fails, you need to escape

### General
1. **Stealth is survival** - Avoid unnecessary fights
2. **Know your limits** - Retreat before it's too late
3. **Use terrain** - Doors, corridors, and obstacles save lives
4. **Save resources** - That potion you use now might be needed later
