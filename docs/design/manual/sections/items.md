## Armor

### Armor Types

| Type | Protection | Evasion Penalty | Notes |
|------|------------|-----------------|-------|
| Robes | [0, 1d1] | 0 | No protection |
| Leather | [0, 1d4] | 0 | Light, no penalty |
| Studded Leather | [0, 2d4] | -1 | Slight penalty |
| Mail | [0, 2d6] | -2 | Good protection |
| Plate | [0, 3d6] | -4 | Heavy, best protection |

Protection notation: [+X, YdZ] means +X to protection rolls, rolling YdZ for damage reduction.

### Helmets, Gloves, Boots

Additional armor pieces provide smaller protection bonuses and sometimes special abilities.

### Shields

Shields increase evasion and can block attacks. Some enemies (Olog-hai) can destroy shields with crushing blows.

## Staves

Staves are two-handed weapons that cast magical effects. They have limited charges that can be restored by combining two staves of the same type.

| Staff | Charges | Effect | Lore Req |
|-------|---------|--------|----------|
| Staff of Light | 8 | Illuminates area, damages undead | 2 |
| Staff of Striking | 6 | Melee attack with knockback | 3 |
| Staff of Opening | 10 | Unlocks doors, breaks holds | 4 |
| Staff of Slumber | 6 | Puts enemy to sleep | 5 |
| Staff of Warding | 5 | Creates blocking glyph (3 turns) | 6 |
| Staff of Revelation | 4 | Reveals traps/secrets in radius | 7 |
| Staff of Sanctity | 4 | Damages/repels undead in radius | 8 |
| Staff of Command | 3 | Stuns/terrifies enemies in cone | 10 |

Higher Lore skill recovers more charges when combining staves.

## Wands

Wands are one-handed items that fire ranged magical bolts. Like staves, charges can be restored by combining.

| Wand | Charges | Effect | Lore Req |
|------|---------|--------|----------|
| Wand of Light | 12 | Light bolt, minor undead damage | 1 |
| Wand of Slow | 8 | Target slowed 10 turns | 3 |
| Wand of Frost | 8 | Cold bolt, slows target | 3 |
| Wand of Fire | 6 | Fire bolt, higher damage | 4 |
| Wand of Sleep | 6 | Target falls asleep | 4 |
| Wand of Fear | 5 | Target flees (Will save) | 5 |
| Wand of Binding | 4 | Target paralyzed 3 turns | 8 |
| Wand of Dispel | 3 | Removes magic, damages summoned | 10 |
| Wand of Death | 2 | Massive damage, instant kill chance | 12 |

## Herbs

Herbs are found throughout the dungeon. The **Herbcraft** ability (Lore 3) doubles their effectiveness.

| Herb | Base Effect | With Herbcraft |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| Athelas (Kingsfoil) | Heal 20 HP, cure poison | Heal 40 HP, cure poison + disease |
| Lissuin | +2 Dex for 20 turns | +4 Dex for 30 turns |
| Miruvor Draught | Heal 10 HP, cure fear | Heal 20 HP, cure fear + restore Will |

| Niphredil | Cures blindness, +2 Perception | +4 Perception 40 turns |
| Alfirin | Slows poison/disease | Halts and partially reverses |
| Black Moss | Poison weapon (5 hits) | Stronger poison, 10 hits |
| Mordor Lichen | Heals 30 HP but -1 Grace permanent | No Grace penalty with Herbcraft |

**Note**: Athelas is very rare. Don't rely on finding it.

Potions always work regardless of skill. Some potions are harmful—learn to identify them!

Identifying potions before drinking is strongly recommended.

## Scrolls

Scrolls are one-use items. Higher Lore reduces backfire chance.

| Scroll of Banishment | Destroys undead in radius | Summons undead |

The **Ancient Tongues** ability (Lore 8) makes scrolls never backfire.

## Combining Items

Some items can be combined:

The Rod of the Istari is required for the Banishment Victory path.
