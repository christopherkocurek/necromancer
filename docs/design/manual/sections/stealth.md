# Stealth Guide

## Philosophy

The Necromancer emphasizes stealth-first gameplay. Unlike many roguelikes where combat is the primary solution, Dol Guldur rewards those who slip through unseen. Every fight you avoid is:
- HP you didn't lose
- Resources you didn't spend
- Alertness you didn't raise
- Time you didn't waste

The goal is to reach Thráin and escape, not to kill everything in your path.

## Stealth Mechanics

### Detection

Monsters detect you through:

1. **Sight** - Enemies in your light radius or with you in theirs can see you
2. **Sound** - Actions generate noise that can alert nearby enemies
3. **Alertness** - High dungeon alertness means more patrols and searches

### Light and Vision

| Your Light | Effect |
|------------|--------|
| None | Enemies within 1 tile may spot you |
| Dim | Enemies within 2-3 tiles may spot you |
| Bright | Enemies within 4+ tiles may spot you |

Darkness helps stealth but limits your own vision. Balance is key.

### Noise

Actions generate noise:

| Action | Noise Level |
|--------|-------------|
| Standing still | None |
| Walking | Low |
| Running | Medium |
| Combat | High |
| Breaking objects | Very High |
| Using loud abilities | Varies |

Higher Stealth skill reduces noise from your actions.

### Alertness System

The dungeon has an overall **Alertness Level** that affects enemy behavior:

| Alertness | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| 0-10 | Normal patrols |
| 11-25 | Increased patrols, some locked doors |
| 26-50 | Ambushes possible, reinforcements arrive |
| 50+ | Full alert, boss enemies may roam |

**Alertness Triggers**:
- Combat: +1-3 depending on noise
- Crebain escapes: +5
- Alarm triggered: +10
- Time: Slow decay

## Stealth Skills and Abilities

### Stealth Skill

Each point of Stealth:
- Reduces noise you generate
- Increases chance of remaining undetected
- Unlocks stealth abilities

### Key Stealth Abilities

**Disguise**
- Appear harmless to some enemies
- Certain creatures may ignore you entirely

**Assassination**
- Massive damage bonus against unaware targets
- One-shot kills on weaker enemies

**Vanish**
- Break contact during combat
- Slip back into shadows

**Silent Running**
- Move at full speed without increased noise
- Essential for escape sequences

### Stealth Affinity

The **Greenwood** house (Elf) grants Stealth affinity:
- +1 Stealth at character creation
- Reduced cost to raise Stealth
- Free starting stealth ability

## Stealth Tactics

### Basic Stealth

1. **Move carefully** - Don't run unless necessary
2. **Manage light** - Dim light or darkness when hiding
3. **Use cover** - Stay behind walls and doors
4. **Wait** - Let patrols pass before moving
5. **Close doors** - Block line of sight behind you

### Avoiding Detection

1. **Spot enemies first** - High Perception lets you see them before they see you
2. **Track patrol patterns** - Enemies move predictably
3. **Use corridors** - Narrow passages let you control engagement
4. **Kill scouts quietly** - Crebain and Orc Scouts must die fast

### When Stealth Fails

Sometimes you're spotted. When this happens:

1. **Break line of sight** - Get behind a wall or door
2. **Don't fight in the open** - Lead enemies to favorable ground
3. **Consider fleeing** - Escape is often better than combat
4. **Use abilities** - Vanish, sleep effects, fear effects
5. **Accept the fight** - If you must fight, fight decisively

### Stealth and Alertness Management

High alertness makes stealth harder. To manage alertness:

1. **Kill Crebain immediately** - Their escape raises alertness by 5
2. **Avoid alarms** - Some traps raise alertness
3. **Don't massacre** - Killing many enemies raises alertness
4. **Let it decay** - Time reduces alertness slowly

## Stealth Builds

### Pure Stealth (Elf of Greenwood)

**Priority Skills**: Stealth > Evasion > Perception > Melee

**Strategy**:
- Avoid almost all combat
- Assassination for necessary kills
- Race to Thráin and escape

**Advantages**: Fast, resource-efficient
**Disadvantages**: Vulnerable when detected

### Stealth-Combat Hybrid

**Priority Skills**: Stealth > Melee > Evasion > Will

**Strategy**:
- Use stealth to choose engagements
- Fight when advantageous
- Avoid unnecessary battles

**Advantages**: Flexible, can handle mistakes
**Disadvantages**: Neither specialized

### Combat with Stealth Support

**Priority Skills**: Melee > Evasion > Stealth > Will

**Strategy**:
- Fight effectively
- Use stealth to avoid overwhelming odds
- Skip optional encounters

**Advantages**: Strong in combat
**Disadvantages**: More resource-intensive

## Stealth-Positive Items

### Armor
- Light armor has no stealth penalty
- Heavy armor reduces stealth significantly

### Artifacts
- **Ranger's Cloak**: +3 Stealth, harder to detect when still
- **Hithlain Leaf**: Temporary stealth boost

### Equipment Considerations
- Light sources reveal you - consider when to use them
- Noisy weapons (axes) may be suboptimal for stealth builds

## Floor-by-Floor Stealth Tips

### Tier 1 (Outer Pits)
- Kill Crebain on sight
- Avoid Orc Scouts or kill quickly
- Spider Webs slow you - don't get stuck while fleeing
- Root Tunnels provide stealth bonus

### Tier 2 (Dark Halls)
- Undead don't sleep - can't be ambushed
- Watch for pit traps while sneaking
- Cave Spiders drop from above - check ceilings

### Tier 3 (Necropolis)
- Ritual Circles spawn undead if disturbed - avoid
- Wraiths have fear auras - may force you to flee
- Lesser Nazgûl should be avoided if possible

### Tier 4 (Inner Sanctum)
- The Shadow causes constant Will drain - move fast
- Enchanted Darkness limits vision both ways
- Sauron's Lidless Eye means true stealth is impossible
- Plan your escape route before taking the Ring

## The Escape (Stealth in Pursuit Mode)

During Pursuit Mode, pure stealth is impossible—Sauron always knows your general location. However:

1. **Enemies still use normal detection** - Stealth helps against minions
2. **Speed matters** - Silent Running lets you move fast quietly
3. **Hidden passages** - Knowledge of escape routes trumps stealth
4. **Distraction** - Enemies chase you; use this to create gaps

The escape is about controlled movement, not invisibility.
