# Skills

## Overview

The Necromancer uses eight skills that determine your character's capabilities:

| Skill | Focus |
|-------|-------|
| **Melee** | Close combat effectiveness |
| **Archery** | Ranged combat with bows |
| **Evasion** | Avoiding attacks, mobility |
| **Stealth** | Moving undetected |
| **Perception** | Awareness, finding secrets |
| **Will** | Mental resistance, courage |
| **Smithing** | Crafting and item improvement |
| **Lore** | Knowledge-based abilities, magical devices |

## How Skills Work

### Skill Checks
Most skill uses involve a check: roll 1d10 + your skill level against a difficulty number. Meeting or exceeding the difficulty means success.

**Example**: Opening a difficulty 15 lock with Perception 8 requires rolling 7+ on 1d10 (8 + 7 = 15).

### Skill Points
You spend experience points to raise skills. The cost increases as skills get higher. See the Experience section for details.

### Skill Affinities
Houses grant affinities to specific skills. An affinity:
- Gives +1 to that skill at character creation
- Reduces the experience cost for raising that skill
- May unlock a free starting ability
