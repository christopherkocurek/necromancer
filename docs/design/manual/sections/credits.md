## The Necromancer

**The Necromancer** is a fan-made roguelike game set in Tolkien's Middle-earth. It is free software, developed by fans for fans.

## Built Upon Giants

The Necromancer is a fork of **Sil-Q**, which is itself a variant of **Sil**, which descends from the venerable **Angband** roguelike tradition.

### Sil
Created by **Scatha** and **Fingolfin**

Sil brought a fresh approach to the roguelike genre with its emphasis on tactical combat, meaningful choices, and deep Tolkien lore. Its innovations in stealth, skill systems, and encounter design form the foundation of The Necromancer.

### Sil-Q
Maintained by the **Sil-Q community**

Sil-Q continued development of Sil with balance improvements, new content, and bug fixes. The Necromancer builds directly on Sil-Q's codebase.

### Angband
Originally by **Ben Harrison**, based on **Moria** by Robert Alan Koeneke

Angband is one of the longest-running open source projects in existence, with development spanning over 30 years. Countless contributors have shaped it into the deep, complex game that inspired Sil and its descendants.

## Tolkien's Legacy

The setting, characters, and lore of The Necromancer are inspired by the works of **J.R.R. Tolkien**, particularly *The Hobbit*, *The Lord of the Rings*, and *The Silmarillion*.
