# The Dungeon: Dol Guldur

## Overview

Dol Guldur—the "Hill of Dark Sorcery"—is divided into four tiers, each deeper and more dangerous than the last. The dungeon descends from the surface (0 ft) to the Pits of Despair (1000 ft) where Thráin is imprisoned.

| Depth | Tier | Name | Theme |
|-------|------|------|-------|
| 50-250 ft | 1 | The Outer Pits | Spider nests, orc warrens, forest roots |
| 250-500 ft | 2 | The Dark Halls | Torture chambers, troll dens, workshops |
| 500-750 ft | 3 | The Necropolis | Crypts, ritual chambers, wraith domains |
| 750-1000 ft | 4 | The Inner Sanctum | Nazgûl halls, prison pits, Sauron's throne |

## Tier 1: The Outer Pits (50-250 ft)

The upper levels of Dol Guldur are still touched by the forest above. Roots break through the walls, and giant spiders have woven their nests throughout the corridors. Orc patrols are frequent but poorly organized.

### Threats
- **Giant Spiders** - Venomous, spin webs that slow movement
- **Orcs** - Scouts, slaves, warriors; will alert others
- **Wargs** - Pack hunters that coordinate attacks
- **Crebain** - Spy birds that increase alertness if they escape
- **Bats** - Erratic movement, can wake nearby enemies

### Terrain Features
- **Spider Webs** - Slow movement, chance to become stuck
- **Fallen Trees** - Block line of sight, can be climbed
- **Poisoned Streams** - Damage over time if crossed
- **Orc Barricades** - Destructible walls
- **Nest Chambers** - Disturbing spawns spiders
- **Root Tunnels** - Narrow passages with stealth bonus

### Boss: Broodmother Spider
Located in a special vault. Stationary but spawns endless Mirkwood Spiders. Destroy the egg sacs around her to weaken her spawning rate.

### Strategy
The Outer Pits are the "learning" zone. Practice stealth here—avoiding fights is often better than winning them. Kill Crebain quickly before they escape and raise alertness.

## Tier 2: The Dark Halls (250-500 ft)

The middle depths are where the Necromancer's servants do their grim work. Torture chambers, troll dens, and sorcerer workshops fill these halls. The enemies here are more organized and dangerous.

### Threats
- **Mirk-Trolls** - Sun-resistant, use poisoned weapons
- **Skeletons & Zombies** - Undead that don't sleep
- **Ghouls** - Paralyzing touch
- **Orc Captains** - Command nearby orcs (+2 attack bonus)
- **Dark Sorcerers** - Cast darkness, fear, curses
- **Easterling Soldiers** - Disciplined, don't flee

### Terrain Features
- **Torture Racks** - Flavor, sometimes loot
- **Forges** - Repair items, assemble Rod of the Istari
- **Troll Caves** - Open areas with boulders for cover
- **Alchemist Tables** - Random potion (may be trapped)
- **Locked Cells** - May contain prisoners, loot, or enemies
- **Pit Traps** - Fall 50 ft, take damage

### Boss: Master Torturer
Found in the Torturer's Workshop vault. His crippling strikes reduce your Dexterity temporarily—the longer the fight, the harder it gets. End it quickly.

### Strategy
Forges become important here—use them to repair equipment. Consider rescuing prisoners for rewards but weigh the alertness cost. Watch for pit traps; falling to a lower level while injured is often fatal.

## Tier 3: The Necropolis (500-750 ft)

The domain of the undead. Ritual chambers hum with dark power, crypts hold ancient evils, and wraiths drift through the corridors. This is where you begin facing truly supernatural threats.

### Threats
- **Wights** - Life drain reduces maximum HP until rest
- **Barrow-wights** - Cast curses, drain stats
- **Necromancer Adepts** - Raise corpses as skeletons
- **Vampires** - Life steal, regenerate
- **Phantoms** - Incorporeal (50% physical attack immunity)
- **Werewolves** - Appear human until close, fast and brutal
- **Black Númenóreans** - Evil sorcerers with dark lore

### Terrain Features
- **Sarcophagi** - May contain loot or spawn wight
- **Ritual Circles** - Disturbing spawns 1d4 skeletons
- **Cursed Glyphs** - Step on = random curse
- **Bone Piles** - Necromancers can raise these
- **Black Altars** - Sacrifice items for risky boons
- **Crypts** - Vault rooms with undead guardians

### Boss: Lesser Nazgûl
A Ringwraith stalks the Necropolis. Immune to normal weapons—you need magical or silver weapons to harm it. Its Black Breath aura forces Will saves or you flee in terror. Its Morgul-blade can inflict permanent wounds.

### Strategy
Stock up on healing before entering Tier 3. Life drain from Wights is devastating—target them first. Don't disturb ritual circles unless you're ready for a fight. The Lesser Nazgûl is a major threat; consider avoiding it if possible.

## Tier 4: The Inner Sanctum (750-1000 ft)

The heart of Dol Guldur. Black Númenórean quarters, Nazgûl halls, and finally the Pits of Despair where Thráin languishes. Sauron himself dwells in the deepest chamber.

### Threats
- **Olog-hai** - Crushing blows destroy shields/armor
- **Vampire Lords** - Mist form makes them temporarily invulnerable
- **Greater Werewolves** - Pack alphas that regenerate
- **Wraiths** - Fear aura requires Will check to approach
- **Fell Spirits** - Can possess corpses mid-fight
- **Shadow Lords** - Extinguish nearby light sources
- **Khamûl the Easterling** - Second Nazgûl, guarding approach to Sauron

### Terrain Features
- **Enchanted Darkness** - Permanent low light
- **The Shadow** - Passive Will drain, fear checks every 10 turns
- **Morgul Braziers** - Green flame with fear aura
- **Escape Routes** - Hidden stairs (reward exploration)
- **Prison Pit** - Thráin's location, your objective
- **Throne Room** - Sauron's chamber

### Boss: Khamûl the Easterling
The second-most powerful Nazgûl. Phase shifts between visible and invisible states. Fear aura, sorcery, Morgul-blade, summons lesser wraiths. Immune to normal weapons.

### Final: Sauron the Necromancer
Cannot be killed through normal means (see Victory Conditions). Always knows your location. Dominating Will forces constant mental resistance checks. Dark sorcery and supernatural darkness.

### Strategy
Will becomes critical here. The Shadow's constant Will drain makes this tier a race against time. Find hidden escape routes for the return journey. Don't fight Sauron—get the Ring and Key from Thráin and run.

## Transition Zones

At tier boundaries (200-250 ft, 450-500 ft, 700-750 ft), you'll find mixed enemy types from both tiers. These serve as warnings that harder challenges await. Look for:
- Graffiti and warnings
- Corpses of previous adventurers
- Darker lighting
- More dangerous patrols

## General Dungeon Tips

1. **Rest carefully** - Resting restores HP but gives enemies time to patrol
2. **Mind your light** - Light helps you see but also helps enemies see you
3. **Use doors** - Closing doors behind you blocks line of sight
4. **Explore thoroughly** - Hidden passages often contain valuable loot
5. **Know when to flee** - Living to fight another day is victory in itself
6. **Manage alertness** - High alertness brings reinforcements and locked doors
