# Races and Houses

## Overview

In The Necromancer, you choose both a **race** and a **house** for your character. Your race determines your base statistics and innate abilities, while your house provides additional stat bonuses and skill affinities that shape your playstyle.

The three playable races are:
- **Elf** - Graceful and perceptive, natural archers
- **Man** - Versatile and determined, skilled with swords
- **Dwarf** - Sturdy and resilient, masters of the axe

Each race has three houses to choose from, representing different peoples and traditions of the Third Age.

## Races

### Elf

**Base Stats**: -1 Str / +2 Dex / +1 Con / +2 Gra (Total: +4)

Elves are the firstborn of Ilúvatar, immortal and fair. Though diminished from their glory in the Elder Days, the Elves of the Third Age remain formidable: swift, perceptive, and deadly with the bow.

**Racial Ability**: Bow Proficiency - Elves gain a bonus when using bows.

**Strengths**: High Dexterity and Grace make Elves excellent archers and stealth characters. Good starting stat total (+4 from race, +1 from house = +5 total).

**Weaknesses**: Lower Strength limits melee damage and carrying capacity.

### Man

**Base Stats**: +1 Str / 0 Dex / +1 Con / 0 Gra (Total: +2)

The race of Men is called the "Aftercomers" by the Elves. Though mortal and shorter-lived, Men possess a drive and adaptability that serves them well in the depths of Dol Guldur.

**Racial Ability**: Sword Proficiency - Men gain a bonus when using swords.

**Strengths**: Balanced starting stats allow for flexible builds. Sword proficiency pairs well with melee-focused houses.

**Weaknesses**: Lower overall stat total (+2 from race, +1-2 from house = +3-4 total) makes Men the challenging choice for new players.

### Dwarf

**Base Stats**: +1 Str / -1 Dex / +3 Con / 0 Gra (Total: +3)

The Dwarves are the creation of Aulë, built to endure. Their high Constitution makes them remarkably resilient, able to survive punishment that would fell an Elf or Man.

**Racial Ability**: Axe Proficiency - Dwarves gain a bonus when using axes.

**Racial Penalty**: Archery Penalty - Dwarves are less skilled with bows.

**Strengths**: Exceptional Constitution allows Dwarves to take hits and keep fighting. Good for melee-focused builds.

**Weaknesses**: The Archery penalty limits ranged options. Lower Dexterity affects Evasion and Stealth.
