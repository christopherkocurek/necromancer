## Summary Recommendations

### KEEP (No Changes)
- Rout (0)
- Fletchery (1)
- Point Blank Archery (2)
- Puncture (3)
- Ambush (4) - CRITICAL stealth synergy
- Crippling Shot (6)
- Deadly Hail (7)
- Dexterity (8)

### MODIFY
- Versatility (5) - Rename or replace. Current name/concept is mechanical, not thematic.

**Proposed Replacement: "Keen Eyes"**
- Effect: You can see enemies one square beyond your normal light radius, and gain +2 to attack at long range
- Tolkien: Elven far-sight, Legolas seeing distant threats
- Stealth Hook: See enemies before they see you

## Archery Tree Assessment

The Archery tree is actually quite solid for Third Age grounding:
- **Ambush** is excellent stealth synergy
- Most abilities have clear combat precedents
- Only Versatility feels mechanical rather than thematic

Tree requires minimal changes - just the Versatility swap.
