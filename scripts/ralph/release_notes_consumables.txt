# The Necromancer Alpha 0.5.1 - Consumables Update

## New Features

### Wands
A new category of magical items that fire targeted effects:
- **Wand of Frost** - Fires a bolt dealing 2d4 cold damage, may slow target
- **Wand of Fire** - Fires a bolt dealing 3d4 fire damage
- **Wand of Slowing** - Slows a single target
- **Wand of Light** - Creates a beam of light, damages light-sensitive creatures
- **Wand of Fear** - Terrifies a single monster
- **Wand of Sleep** - Puts a monster to sleep

Wands use charges like staves. The Channeling ability increases charges.

### New Consumables
- **Potion of Shadows** - Grants invisibility and dims your light for 15d4 turns
- **Flute of the Fairy** - Creates concealing mists around you (low noise)
- **Cram** - Dale waybread, provides 2000 nutrition (excellent trail food)
- **Pipe-weed (Old Toby)** - Grants temporary +2 Grace and calmness

### Alchemy Improvements
The Alchemy ability now allows combining two identical herbs to create
improved versions:
- Concentrated Herb of Healing - Heals 8d6 health
- Potent Athelas - Removes all negative effects and heals 4d6
- Concentrated Waymeal - Provides 4000 nutrition
- Potent Rage Mushroom - Grants 20d4 turns of +3 Str/Dex and +5 damage

## Balance Changes

### Harmful Consumable Removal
Once identified, harmful consumables no longer appear in loot drops:
- Potions: Slowness, Poison, Blindness, Confusion, Awkwardness, Disconnection
- Herbs: Emptiness, Entrancement, Weakness, Sickness

This reduces inventory frustration without removing the identification mini-game.

### Item Renames (Tolkien Theme)
- Horn of Warning → Horn of Challenge (now aggravates monsters)
- Generic potion names updated for setting consistency
- Generic herb names updated for setting consistency

## Technical Notes
- Added TV_WAND (56) item type infrastructure
- Wand charging uses Channeling multiplier like staves
- Improved herbs set to depth 99 with INSTA_ART (crafting output only)
